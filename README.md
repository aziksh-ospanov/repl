# A Read-Eval-Print Loop for Lean 4 with Enhanced Information Extraction Capabilities

This project is a fork of the [leanprover-community/repl](https://github.com/leanprover-community/repl) repository, augmented with additional features to support advanced information extraction. The enhancements are implemented in `REPL/ExtractData.lean`, which has been adapted from [lean-dojo/LeanDojo](https://github.com/lean-dojo/LeanDojo/blob/main/src/lean_dojo/data_extraction/ExtractData.lean).

To see an example of how these features can be utilized, refer to the files `test/aime_1983_p9.in` and `test/aime_1983_p9.expected.out`. These examples demonstrate the practical application and output of the enhanced information extraction capabilities.
